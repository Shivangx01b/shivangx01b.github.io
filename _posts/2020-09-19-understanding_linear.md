## Introduction

**Linear regression** stands as one of the most fundamental algorithms in the realm of machine learning and predictive analytics. Rooted in statistical modeling, it serves as a cornerstone technique, particularly for those embarking on their data science journey. The beauty of linear regression lies in its simplicity and interpretability, making it an invaluable tool for making predictions based on relationships between numerical variables.

At its core, linear regression aims to establish a linear relationship between a **dependent variable** (often denoted as y) and one or more **independent variables** (denoted as x). The model predicts the outcome (y) as a linear combination of the input variables (x). This simplicity, however, belies its power and versatility in various applications, ranging from economics and healthcare to engineering and beyond.

In the upcoming sections, we will delve deep into the mathematical underpinnings of linear regression. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for appreciating how the algorithm makes predictions and how it can be fine-tuned for better performance. We will explore the key concepts such as the linear regression equation, the cost function, and the optimization process.

Following this, we'll transition into the practical aspects of linear regression, showcasing its implementation in two of the most popular machine learning frameworks: **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. These sections will not only include detailed code examples but will also provide insights into the unique features and approaches of each framework. Whether you are a novice in the field or looking to refresh your knowledge, this comprehensive guide will equip you with both the theoretical understanding and practical skills to master linear regression.

Stay tuned as we embark on this exciting journey to unravel the intricacies of linear regression and harness its power in PyTorch and TensorFlow!. And will try to predict **House price** which Linear regression model
